# Modern Patient WristBand with Flutter Mobile Application

To maximize patient safety, the World Health Organization (WHO) set six goals, which are considered a real health challenge worldwide. Patient identification was considered the first goal for safe care, and its main goal is to ensure that the correct care and treatment protocols are performed on the correct patient. Today, in many countries, at least two identifiers written on a paper wristband and attached to one of the four organs of the patient are used to identify the patient. If paper wristbands are used, the patient identification information may be removed or illegible due to poor design, low resistance to paper tearing, and deformation due to moisture. According to the clinical experiences presented in the studies, some factors such as moving the patient from one bed to another in the same ward, the patient’s state of consciousness, transferring the patient from one ward to another, not having a companion, the inability to speak in some patients such as children, etc, may increase the possibility of error in the patient identification process. Also, in paper wristbands, only demographic identifiers are used, while if the patient’s clinical information is also available in this way, the medical visit and nursing care will be done in a more favorable way. Considering that today’s clinical environment is very dynamic and demanding and so far modern technology has not been used to solve the above problems, therefore, smart wristbands to increase patient safety and quick access to the clinical information of patients in the educational and treatment center of Imam Reza General Hospital Tabriz was designed in 2023.

## Conclusion: 
* A smart wristband and health information software with a special QR code is designed for each patient. Doctors and nurses can connect to the patient’s health information software by scanning the QR code, entering their medical and nursing system numbers, and accessing the patient’s demographic and clinical information.

* The design of smart wristbands makes it possible to use waterproof electronic wristbands instead of using paper wristbands. Also, by scanning the assigned code for each patient, the treatment and care staff are connected to health information software that provides quick access to a summary of demographic information, past treatment history, and current clinical information of the patient during visits and care.
